Mobile Architect and Programming

**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The app I developed is an inventory tracking app that allows users to keep track of the amount of stock they have of various items. It has several features such as a log in database, stock database, SMS messaging when stock reaches low levels. This app addresses the needs of a business owner that wants an easy way to keep track of inventory on a mobile device.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

This app uses three main screens: a login screen that authenticates user logins and permissions, an inventory screen that displays in stock items with associated details such as amount remaining and location, and a settings screen that allows the user to enable SMS messaging to alert them when stock levels are low.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

I designed this app one screen at a time, and utilized a bottom bar fragment to navigate between the pages. I looked at some tutorials online for navigating screens, as well as other resources to build my app bit by bit.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

I tested my code by using the emulator that came with Android Studio. After making some changes I started the emulator up and did some testing to see how my code worked in real time. Changing screens and entering in info and checking previous segments to ensure they still worked.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

I was having issues implementing the database that would be responsible for storing what items are on hand. I ended up having to look around online for other tutorials/advice on how to get it to work. It was pretty tricky as it wasn't really something I had done before.

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I think I did a good job using industry standard of commenting, using correct naming techniques and having clean code in general. I want my code to be readable by anyone else that would have to work on it, or even me in the future if I come back to change some things I should understand how it works after some time has passed.
